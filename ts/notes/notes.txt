Typescript it's a development tool. The project still runs JS. 
It helps you to write better code with less problems, more scalable and understandable.

What typescript does:

Static Checking - Check my code as I try to write it. Analyze the code as we type.

How it works:

You write the typescript code, and that code is transpiled into Javascript.

Types:

Number - String - Boolean
Null - Unefined - Void
Object - Array - Tuples
Any 

Typescript can detected the type you want (Be careful with functions.)
Any - When you don't specify a type, typescript can't infer it from context, the compiler will typically default to any.
